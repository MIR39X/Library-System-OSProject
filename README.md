# ðŸ“š Library Book Borrowing System

A multi-threaded simulation of the classic **Reader-Writer problem**, implemented using `pthreads`, `mutexes`, and `semaphores` in **C**. This project models students (readers) accessing a library's book records while librarians (writers) update them â€” developed as part of our **Operating Systems semester project**.
